# disk-sorting-application
Java application that implements two greedy algorithms to sort disks of alternating patterns. The user enters the number of disks to sort, the algorithms sort the disks, and the results are printed to an output file along with metrics gathered during execution. Project documentation includes an analysis of the runtime complexity, and proofs of correctness for the algorithms using mathematical induction.
